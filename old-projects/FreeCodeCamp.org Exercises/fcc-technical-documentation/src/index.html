      <p>One of the most overlooked and yet commonly in need of repair parts of a washing machine is the hose pipes. These should be inspected at least once a month. There should be no cracks or bulges among it. They should also be fitted properly.</p>
      
      <p>If either of these things are occuring, the chances of a leakage is quite high. The fittings sholuld be the perfect size and very tight.</p>

      <p>It is important to use the right type of detergent for the right type of washing machine. There are, for example:
        <ul>
          <li>Anionic detergents</li>
          <li>Non-ionic detergents</li>
          <li>Cationic detergents</li>
          <li>Fuel additives</li>
          <li>Biological reagent</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are some more, but these are some of the most widely used types. Which one that would be best to use for your specific machine depends on some factors such as energy effeciency and manafacturer standards, and we would reccomend consulting your manual for relative information.</p>
      <p>It is also important to use the right amount of detergent, as too much can leave residue behind, making it hard to clean up and easy to build up. If liquid detergent is used, it is important to measure in accordance to the directions provided by the manafacturer.

      <p>The inside (and outside, but more on that in the next section) should be cleaned often, for sake of simplicity and at the most, at least monthly. This is not just for keeping it smelling fresh, but it helps to keep mildew and mold from growing over time, saving the machine from some other potentially nasty fixes.<p>
      
      <p>We suggest this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mix 3 cups of vinegar with Â½ a cup of baking soda, and add this mixture to the washer.</li>
        <li>Set the washing machine's setting to large load and hot water.</li>
        <li>Finally, turn it on and allow the cycle to complete and rinse.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Alternatively, a sponge could be used to wipe the inside of the machine instead.</p>

    <article>
      <p>The exterior of the washing machine should be cleaned as much as the interior, and with it, there is a little bit more to cover.</p>
      
      <p>It is important to clean the drum, door, and gasket often, at least once a month. To do this, mix water and vinegar in a 1:1 ratio. Otherwise, odour can start to seep into the laundry, among other possible more techinical issues. The dryer ventaliation tube and cap should be routinley cleaned as well. It is located in the rear of the machine and outside of the home (respectively,) and purchasing a long brush might help. Doing this prevents derbis from building up and ensures maximum air flow.<p>

      <p>Consistently loading your washing machine over its limit can lead to some unintended consequences. It has an intended capacity, and going over this can damage the machine. If need be, break the loads into smaller sections to ensure the structural integrity of your washing machine.</p>
