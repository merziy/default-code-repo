# RESTful C.R.U.D API

This is a basic RESTful CRUD api built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Mongoose is also used (It's an Object Document Mapping(ODM) tool, meaning it converts objects in the code to the documents in the MongoDB database, ad vice versa.) it also uses the Body-Parser library for parsing data, which converts text sent through a HTTP request to a target format which you can extract relevant information.

I followed a few walkthroughs online and built it to both showcase a project and to learn what exactly both a CRUD anda RESTful API is.
