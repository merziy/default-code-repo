      <h2>Short Biography</h2>
        <p>Akira Kurosawa (1910 - 1998) is one of the most well-respected directors of artistic cinema of all time, certaintly in his home country of Japan. He has a long lasting influence in filmmaking and directed about 30 films in a career that lasted 60 years. His crowning achievement is generally considered to be the jidaigeki Seven Samurai (1954) and he wrote a lot of material in that setting. Not a one trick pony, however, he wrote screenplays in a varitey of genres such as drama (Stray Dog, 1949/Ikiru, 1952) and surrealist fantasies (Dreams, 1990.)

      <p><i>“No matter where I go in the world, although I can't speak any foreign language, I don't feel out of place. I think of earth as my home. If everyone thought this way, people might notice just how foolish international friction is and they would put an end to it.” - Akira Kurosawa, Something Like an Autobiography (1982)
