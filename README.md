# Exercise-projects

## Description

This is my general repo where I store the majority code I write when I am learning new technologies, methodologies, or code that comes from entrance tests during coding interviews.

## Contents

Programming languages include HTML, CSS, JavaSript, TypeScript, PHP, C, Kotlin, really a littke bit of everything. Includes JS frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue, Angular, ChartJS, jQuery, and more. I experiment with RESTful API's, the backend, servers, etc.
